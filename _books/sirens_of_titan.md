Goodreads.com, The Sirens of Titan. Rating: 4.15/5 (156,540 ratings): 

The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality. The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitation—and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.

> I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all.
