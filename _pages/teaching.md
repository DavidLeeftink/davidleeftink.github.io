### Workgroup Coordinator & Guest Lecturer
* **Bayesian Machine Learning** (M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence, 2024-2025)
  * *Modern probabilistic (in particular, Bayesian) inference in machine learning: students learn theory and practice about topics including Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, MCMC, Bayesian optimization.*
  * **Coordination**: Designed the complete practical track, including weekly assignments, practical sessions, and the final capstone project.
  * **Lecturing**: Delivered a guest lecture on *Decision-making under Uncertainty*, which received a student rating of **9.7/10**.
  

### Student Supervision 
* **Marco Post** (M.Sc. Computing Science, 2024-2025), main supervisor - *Transfer Learning in High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization*
* **Luca Pattavina** (M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence, 2025-2026), co-supervisor - *Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization for Laser Dicing*
* **Adem Kaya** (M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence, 2025-2026), advisor - *Efficient Learning of Neural Policies under Partially Observability.*
